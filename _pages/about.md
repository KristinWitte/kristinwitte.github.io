I am a senior-year Doctoral Researcher in Computational Psychiatry in the [Institute for Human-Centered AI](https://hcai-munich.com) at [Helmholtz Munich](https://helmholtz-munich.de) and the [Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich](https://lmu.de) under the supervison of [Dr. Eric Schulz](https://hcai-munich.com/eric.html).

My research spans two main areas. First, I develop reliable computational models of human decision-making and study how these processes relate to symptoms of anxiety and depression. Second, I investigate how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used to understand and support mental health. This work includes examining how anxious responding can be induced in LLMs, and building an LLM system capable of supervising and improving Cognitive Behavioural Therapy.

Through this work I have become very interested in AI Safety and findings ways to optimally evaluate LLMs in an effort to predict and prevent catastrophic consequences of emerging AI technologies. I am eargerly learning about AI alignment techniques as well as AI evaluations and stress-testing.

More broadly, I am committed to finding a way that research can have a real impact on people's well-being.

Next to my research, I enjoy bouldering, hiking, dancing, reading, sailing and generally spending time outdoors.
