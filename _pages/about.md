I am a senior-year PhD Student in Computational Psychiatry in the [Institute for Human-Centered AI](https://hcai-munich.de) at [Helmholtz Munich](https://helmholtz-munich.de) and the [Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich](https://lmu.de) under the supervison of [Dr. Eric Schulz](https://hcai-munich.com/eric.html).

My research agenda broadly follows two main avenues: One the one hand, I am interested in applying methods from Cognitive Computational Modelling to investigate the cognitive mechanisms involved in decision making and its relationship to symptoms of depression and anxiety. In the context of this research avenue I also investigated the reliability and validity of model-derived exploration parameters across several established exploration-exploitation tasks. On the other hand, I am investigating how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used to understand and treat mental disorders. I conducted several studies testing how anxious responding can be induced in LLMs and am currently in the process of building an LLM that can supervise and improve Cognitive Behavioural Therapy.

Next to my research, I deeply enjoy bouldering, hiking, dancing, reading, sailing and generally spending time outdoors.
